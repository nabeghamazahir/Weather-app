# weather_app

The briefest description of my cool project and why you should all use it.

## :computer: [Click here]() to see our live project!

## :page_facing_up: About
The library app has the following functionalities:

- Users can search for a location and view the current weather conditions.
- The app provides personalized attire recommendations for different weather types, including summer, moderate, and winter.
- Users can create an account, log in, and save their preferred attires for different weather conditions.
- The app allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on their saved attires.

```zsh
$ 
```
- home page


## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- For our planning phase of the Weather Attire App, We focused on defining the app's requirements and features, which includes the different attire categories for summer, moderate, and winter weather. We also created basic wireframes and UI/UX on figma to visualize the app's structure and logic.

## :rocket: Cool tech
- React.js for building the frontend user interface.
- Node.js and Express.js for the backend server and API endpoints.
- Weather API for retrieving weather data.
- PostgreSQL database to store user accounts and the attire data
- HTML, CSS for frontend

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- admin page not done

## :sob: Lessons learnt
What I would do differently if I could wind back the clock...
- organise the code better and push the code more often to track what I have changed.

## :white_check_mark: Future features
Cool things I would add if I can keep working on this
- Search functionality to allow users to search for specific books.
- Sorting and filtering options for better book organization.
